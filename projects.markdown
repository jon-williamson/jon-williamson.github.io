I work on the philosophy of causality, the foundations of probability, formal epistemology, inductive logic, and the use of causality, probability and inference methods in science, medicine, AI and law.

I’m Professor of Reasoning, Inference and Scientific Method, in the Philosophy Department at the University of Kent. I’m a member of the Theoretical Reasoning research cluster and the Health Methodology Group, and I’m a co-director of the Centre for Reasoning at Kent. I’m also Honorary Professor of Philosophy of Science and Medicine at University College London.

I currently teach:
 - Introduction to Philosophy: Logic and Reasoning;
 - Logic;
 - Philosophy of Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence;
 - Reason.
