<img style="float: right;" src="images/telescope.jpg" alt="" width="300"  />This is a metaphysical account of causality that analyses causality in terms of rational causal beliefs.

*   This account focuses on the relation between rational causal beliefs and evidence.
*   It is analogous to an epistemic (i.e., Bayesian) theory of probability.
*   According to this view, causal beliefs aren’t beliefs about some non-epistemic causal relation – they are a kind of belief, just as, under an epistemic interpretation, probabilistic beliefs are a kind of belief (degree of belief).
*   The causal facts are those causal claims that any optimal causal epistemology would deem to be established on the basis of total evidence.

Taylor &amp; Jon Williamson:<strong> <a title="The epistemic theory of causality views causality as a tool that helps us to predict, explain and control our world, rather than as a relation that exists independently of our epistemic practices. In this chapter, we first provide an introduction to the epistemic theory of causality. We then outline four considerations that motivate the epistemic theory: the failure of standard theories of causality; parsimony; the epistemology of causality; and neutrality. We illustrate these four considerations in the contexts of the social sciences and the cognitive sciences. We argue that the epistemic theory provides a very natural account of causality across these contexts.">Epistemic causality and its application to the social and cognitive sciences</a></strong>, in Y.

<p>Jon Williamson: <strong><a title="The epistemic theory of causality is analogous to epistemic theories of probability. Most proponents of epistemic probability would argue that one's degrees of belief should be calibrated to chances, insofar as one has evidence of chances. The question arises as to whether causal beliefs should satisfy an analogous calibration norm. In this paper, I formulate a particular version of a norm requiring calibration to chances and argue that this norm is the most fundamental evidential norm for epistemic probability. I then develop an analogous calibration norm for epistemic causality, argue that it is the *only* evidential norm required for epistemic causality, and show how an epistemic account of causality that incorporates this norm can be used to analyse objective causal relationships.">Calibration for epistemic causality</a></strong>, <em>Erkenntnis</em> 86(4):941-960, 2021. <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10670-019-00139-w.pdf"><img class="alignnone" src="../images/openaccess.jpg" alt="" width="44" height="16" border="0" /></a><a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10670-019-00139-w.pdf"><img class="alignnone" src="../images/acrobat.gif" alt="" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a> doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10670-019-00139-w">10.1007/s10670-019-00139-w</a></p>

<p>Michael Wilde &amp; Jon Williamson: <strong><a title="The epistemic theory of causality maintains that causality is an epistemic relation, so that causality is taken to be a feature of the way a subject reasons about the world rather than a non-epistemological feature of the world.

<p>Jon Williamson: <strong><a title="The mechanistic and causal accounts of explanation are often conflated to yield a &#096;causal-mechanical' account. This paper prizes them apart and asks: if the mechanistic account is correct, how can causal explanations be explanatory? The answer to this question varies according to how causality itself is understood. It is argued that difference-making, mechanistic, dualist and inferentialist accounts of causality all struggle to yield explanatory causal explanations, but that an epistemic account of causality is more promising in this regard.">How can causal explanations explain?</a></strong> <em>Erkenntnis</em> 78:257-275, 2013. <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: small"><a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10670-013-9512-x.pdf"><img src="../images/acrobat.gif" alt="" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a></span> <a href="/publications/documents/CausalityExplanation.pdf"><img src="../images/acrobat.gif" alt="" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a> doi: <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10670-013-9512-x">10.1007/s10670-013-9512-x</a></p>

<p>Federica Russo and Jon Williamson: <strong><a title="Causal claims in biomedical contexts are ubiquitous albeit that they are not always made explicit. This paper addresses the question of what causal claims mean in the context of disease. It is argued that in medical contexts causality ought to be interpreted according to the epistemic theory. The epistemic theory offers an alternative to traditional accounts that cash out causation either in terms of ‘difference-making’ relations or in terms of mechanisms. According to the epistemic approach, causal claims tell us about which inferences (e.g., diagnoses and prognoses) are appropriate, rather than about the presence of some physical causal relation analogous to distance or gravitational attraction. It is shown that the epistemic theory has important consequences for medical practice, in particular with regard to the evidence based causal assessment.">Epistemic causality and evidence-based medicine</a></strong>, <em>History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences</em> 33(4):563-582, 2011. <a href="/publications/documents/epcause-medicine2011.pdf"><img id="IMG28" src="../images/acrobat.gif" alt="" border="0" /></a></p>

<p>Federica Russo and Jon Williamson: <strong><a title="We argue that the health sciences make causal claims on the basis of evidence both of physical mechanisms and of probabilistic dependencies. Consequently, an analysis of causality solely in terms of physical mechanisms, or solely in terms of probabilistic relationships, does not do justice to the causal claims of these sciences. Yet there seems to be a single concept of cause in these sciences - pluralism about causality will not do either. Instead, we maintain, the health sciences require a theory of causality that unifies its mechanistic and probabilistic aspects. We argue that the *epistemic* theory of causality provides the required unification.">Interpreting causality in the health sciences</a></strong>, <em>International Studies in the Philosophy of Science</em> 21(2): 157-170, 2007. <a href="/publications/documents/interpreting_causality2007.pdf"><img id="IMG1" src="../images/acrobat.gif" alt="" border="0" /></a> doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/02698590701498084">10.1080/02698590701498084</a></p>

<p>Jon Williamson:<strong> <a title="It is tempting to analyse causality in terms of just one of the indicators of causal relationships, e.g., mechanisms, probabilistic dependencies or independencies, counterfactual conditionals or agency considerations. While such an analysis will surely shed light on some aspect of our concept of cause, it will fail to capture the whole, rather multifarious, notion. So one might instead plump for pluralism: a different analysis for a different occasion. But we do not seem to have lots of different concepts of cause - just one eclectic notion. The resolution of this conundrum, I think, requires us to accept that our causal beliefs are generated by a wide variety of indicators, but to deny that this variety of indicators yields a variety of concepts of cause. This focus on the relation between evidence and causal beliefs leads to what I call *epistemic* causality. Under this view, certain causal beliefs are appropriate or rational on the basis of observed evidence; our notion of cause can be understood purely in terms of these rational beliefs. Causality, then, is a feature of our epistemic representation of the world, rather than of the world itself. This yields one, multifaceted notion of cause.">Causal pluralism versus epistemic causality</a></strong>, <em><a href="https://www.philosophica.ugent.be/issue/17257/info/">Philosophica</a></em> 77(1), pp. 69-96, 2006; <a href="https://www.philosophica.ugent.be/article/82198/galley/202012/download/"><img src="../images/acrobat.gif" alt="" border="0" /></a> <a href="/publications/documents/plurality.pdf"><img src="../images/acrobat.gif" alt="" border="0" /></a> doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.21825/philosophica.82198">10.21825/philosophica.82198</a></p>

<p>Jon Williamson:<strong> <a title="I put forward several desiderata that a philosophical theory of causality should satisfy: it should account for the objectivity of causality, it should underpin formalisms for causal reasoning, it should admit a viable epistemology, it should be able to cope with the great variety of causal claims that are made, and it should be ontologically parsimonious. I argue that Nancy Cartwright's dispositional account of causality goes part way towards meeting these criteria but is lacking in important respects. I go on to argue that my epistemic account, which ties causal relationships to an agent's knowledge and ignorance, performs well in the light of the desiderata. Such an account, I claim, is all we require from a theory of causality.">Dispositional versus epistemic causality</a></strong>, <em>Minds and Machines</em> 16, pp. 259-276, 2006; <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11023-006-9033-3"><img src="../images/acrobat.gif" alt="" border="0" /></a> <a href="/publications/documents/dispositions2006.pdf"><img src="../images/acrobat.gif" alt="" border="0" /></a> doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11023-006-9033-3">10.1007/s11023-006-9033-3</a></p>
