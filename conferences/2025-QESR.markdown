13 November 2025. 1-5.30pm, [Arthur Lewis Building](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/about/maps/interactive-map/?id=33) 2.016/2.017 Boardroom, in-person only. 

The focus of this workshop is on the roles that qualitative evidence synthesis may play in evidence-based policy. Examples of questions that are relevant are: Can approaches such as meta-ethnography provide evidence of the effectiveness of a policy, and if so, how? Do qualitative syntheses mitigate the shortcomings of quantitative meta-analyses, or do they provide evidence for some kind of policy-relevant claim on their own?  The workshop will discuss how these approaches to research synthesis can and should be used in evidence-based policy.
