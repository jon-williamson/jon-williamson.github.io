According to [Evidential Pluralism](/ep), mechanistic studies should be scrutinised alongside comparative studies when evaluating a causal claim. This leads to new approaches to [evidence-based medicine](https://ebmplus.org) and [evidence-based policy making](https://ebpplus.org), for example. Talks in this series consider Evidential Pluralism or alternative approaches to handling diversity of evidence in causal enquiry.
