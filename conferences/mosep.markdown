<a href="/ep"><img style="float: right;"  src="/images/EP-logo.jpg" alt="" width="200"   border="0" /></a> According to [Evidential Pluralism](/ep), mechanistic studies should be scrutinised alongside comparative studies when evaluating a causal claim. This leads to new approaches to [evidence-based medicine](https://ebmplus.org) and [evidence-based policy making](https://ebpplus.org), for example. Talks in this series consider Evidential Pluralism or alternative approaches to handling diversity of evidence in causal enquiry.

> In [other work](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/largen-qualitative-analysis-lnqa-causal-generalization-in-case-study-and-multimethod-research/7A848B3BCC7E01924F32754B7ACCE5B3), we have explored methodological issues around a research approach we call Large-N Qualitative Analysis (LNQA). The core of the method combines a consideration of regularities and within-case causal inference of all cases falling within a specified scope. In this talk, we outline a particular variant of this approach: multimethod LNQA or M-LNQA. The distinctive feature of M-LNQA is that it combines a statistical and LNQA component and thus raises interesting issues about evidential pluralism: how evidence of very different sorts can be combined to strengthen inference.
