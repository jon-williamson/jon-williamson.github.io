I’m interested in an enquiry-driven approach to philosophy: developing accounts of how best to establish key claims (e.g., causal claims and probabilistic claims), and using these normative accounts of enquiry to motivate particular metaphysical theories or conceptual analyses (of, e.g., causality and probability).

<img align="right" width="200" src="images/wordcloud.png">I like this sort of approach because it enables two-way interactions between philosophy and other disciplines. In one direction, normative accounts of enquiry are often most successful if they are firmly rooted in scientific practice. In the other, good accounts of enquiry can help to inform practice.
