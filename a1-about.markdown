I work on the philosophy of causality, the foundations of probability, formal epistemology, inductive logic, and the use of causality, probability and inference methods in science, medicine, AI and law.

I'm the current Samuel Hall Chair of Philosophy at the [University of Manchester](https://www.socialsciences.manchester.ac.uk/philosophy/). I'm also Honorary Professor of Philosophy of Science and Medicine at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/sts/) and Honorary Professor of Philosophy at the University of Kent, where I was Professor of Reasoning, Inference and Scientific Method until December 2024.

My office is 2.43 in the [Humanities Bridgeford Street Building](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/about/maps/interactive-map/?id=32). [///voices.robots.these](https://w3w.co/voices.robots.these)
