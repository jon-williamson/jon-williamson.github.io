<img style="float: right;" src="images/ISR.jpg" alt="" width="300"  />What is the best way to evaluate whether an intervention works? Orthodox ‘evidence-based’ evaluation methods review certain kinds of studies (especially randomised trials) but exclude other relevant evidence (such as mechanistic studies and views of stakeholders). 

This project will apply a new philosophical theory of causal enquiry, Evidential Pluralism, to provide systematic foundations for a broader approach to evidence review—one that includes a diverse range of evidence from across disciplines. This approach promises better informed and more inclusive evaluations. A new review of the effectiveness of face masks will help to test the approach. 

This project is supported by the new [UKRI interdisciplinary scheme](https://www.ukri.org/news/first-projects-from-ukris-new-interdisciplinary-scheme-announced/) and runs for 2 years from 16th January 2025.
