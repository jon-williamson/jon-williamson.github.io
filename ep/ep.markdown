[Evidential Pluralism](https://blogs.kent.ac.uk/evidential-pluralism/) is a theory of causal enquiry. It holds that:
- Establishing causation normally requires establishing that the putative cause and effect are both appropriately correlated and connected by an appropriate mechanism ('object pluralism');
- So, evaluating causation requires scrutinising both association studies and mechanistic studies, where available ('study pluralism').

<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Alexandra Trofimov and Jon Williamson: <strong><a title="Evidence-based law seeks to make best use of evidence to assess the effectiveness of laws and regulations. The question arises as to how exactly to make best use of evidence. This paper argues that Evidential Pluralism provides an answer to this question, and can thus provide philosophical foundations for evidence-based law. Evidential Pluralism is a theory of causal enquiry which maintains that one needs to scrutinise mechanistic studies alongside the experimental and observational studies that are the focus of present-day evidence-based medicine and evidence-based policy. The paper develops a new approach to evidence-based law, called EBL+, based on the principles of Evidential Pluralism. Three examples show how the proposed methods work: banning hand-held mobile phone use while driving, sugar tax, and face-mask mandates for controlling Covid-19.">Applying Evidential Pluralism to evidence-based law: EBL+</a></strong>, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/rjpn20"><em>Jurisprudence</em></a>.  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/20403313.2025.2449758"><img class="alignnone" src="/images/openaccess.jpg" alt="" width="44" height="16" border="0" /><img class="alignnone" src="/images/acrobat.gif" alt="" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a> <!--  <a href="/publications/documents/IBE-Bayesianism.pdf"><img class="alignnone" src="images/acrobat.gif" alt="" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a> --> Doi <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/20403313.2025.2449758">10.1080/20403313.2025.</a></p>

Hitherto, Evidential Pluralism has been applied to medicine, leading to the EBM+ programme, which recommends that evidence-based medicine should systematically evaluate mechanistic studies alongside clinical studies. This paper argues that Evidential Pluralism can also be fruitfully applied to the social sciences. In particular, Evidential Pluralism provides (i) a new approach to evidence-based policy; (ii) a new account of the evidential relationships in more theoretical research; and (iii) new philosophical motivation for mixed methods research.

For some motivation for EBM+, see
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Jon Williamson: <strong><a title="Russo and Williamson (2007) maintain that in order to establish a causal claim in medicine, one normally needs to establish both that the putative cause and putative effect are appropriately correlated and that there is some underlying mechanism that can account for this correlation. I argue that, although this thesis conflicts with the tenets of contemporary evidence-based medicine (EBM), it offers a better causal epistemology than that provided by EBM because it better explains two key aspects of causal discovery. First, it better explains the role of clinical trials in establishing causal claims. Second, it provides a better account of the logic of extrapolation.">Establishing causal claims in medicine</a></strong>, <em>International Studies in the Philosophy of Science</em> 32(1): 33-61, 2019. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02698595.2019.1630927?needAccess=true"><img class="alignnone" src="/images/openaccess.jpg" alt="" width="44" height="16" border="0" /></a><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02698595.2019.1630927?needAccess=true"><img class="alignnone" src="/images/acrobat.gif" alt="" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a>  doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/02698595.2019.1630927">10.1080/02698595.2019.1630927</a></p>

 	<li>Marissa LeBlanc, Jon Williamson, Francesco De Pretis, Juergen Landes &amp; Elena Rocca: <strong><a title="This paper discusses the issue of overriding the right of individual consent to participation in cluster randomised trials (CRTs). We focus on CRTs testing the efficacy of non-pharmaceutical interventions. As one example, we use the case of school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic. In Norway, a cluster randomized trial was suggested and promoted as necessary for providing the best evidence to inform pandemic management policy. However, the proposal was rejected by the Norwegian Research Ethics Committee since it would violate the requirement for individual informed consent. This sparked debate about whether ethics stand in the way of evidence-based health policy, since the Norwegian Research Ethics law’s strict requirements for individual consent make it practically impossible to carry out CRTs of public health interventions. We argue that, in the case of the school closure trial, the suggested CRT would not have eliminated an epistemic gap and thus would not have justified the violation of consent rights. First, we focus on the methodological challenges to estimating quantifiable effects of school closures in the specific case of an airborne infectious disease. Second, in line with Evidential Pluralism, we highlight the value of alternative lines of evidence for informing school closure policy in a pandemic. In general, we propose that a trial requiring the waiver of participants’ consent rights must be highly likely to eliminate an epistemic gap. We elaborate on the practical aspects of this criterion and discuss the potential advantages of adding it to the Ottawa Statement on the Ethical Design and Conduct of Cluster Randomized Trials.">Individual consent in cluster randomised trials for non-pharmaceutical interventions: Going beyond the Ottawa Statement</a></strong>, <em>Critical Public Health</em> 34(1): 2338074, 2024. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/09581596.2024.2338074"><img class="alignnone" src="/images/openaccess.jpg" alt="" width="44" height="16" border="0" /><img class="alignnone" src="/images/acrobat.gif" alt="" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a> doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/09581596.2024.2338074">10.1080/09581596.2024.2338074</a></li>

Kelly and Jon Williamson: <strong><a title="Evidence-based medicine (EBM), the dominant approach to assessing the effectiveness of clinical and public health interventions, focuses on the results of association studies. EBM+ is a development of EBM that systematically considers mechanistic studies alongside association studies. In this paper we provide several examples of the importance of mechanistic evidence to coronavirus research. (i) Assessment of combination therapy for MERS highlights the need for systematic assessment of mechanistic evidence. (ii) That hypertension is a risk factor for severe disease in the case of SARS-CoV-2 suggests that altering hypertension treatment might alleviate disease, but the mechanisms are complex, and it is essential to consider and evaluate multiple mechanistic hypotheses. (iii) To be confident that public health interventions will be effective requires a detailed assessment of social and psychological components of the mechanisms of their action, in addition to mechanisms of disease. (iv) In particular, if vaccination programmes are to be effective, they must be carefully tailored to the social context; again, mechanistic evidence is crucial.
