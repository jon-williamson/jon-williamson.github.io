Through case studies in sociology, economics, political science and law, it advances new philosophical foundations for causal enquiry in the social sciences. The book provides an account of how to establish and evaluate causal claims and it offers a new way of thinking about evidence-based policy, basic social science research and mixed methods research. As such, it will appeal to scholars with interests in social science research and methodology, the philosophy of science and evidence-based policy.">Evidential Pluralism in the Social Sciences</a></strong>, Routledge 2023.

<span style="color: #800000">Samuel D. Taylor and Jon Williamson: </span><strong><a title="Cognitive theorists routinely disagree about the evidence supporting claims in cognitive science. Here, we first argue that some disagreements about evidence in cognitive science are about the evidence available to be drawn upon by cognitive theorists. Then, we show that one's explanation of why this first kind of disagreement obtains will cohere with one's theory of evidence. We argue that the best explanation for why cognitive theorists disagree in this way is because their evidence is what they rationally grant. Finally, we explain why our view does not lead to a pernicious kind of relativism in cognitive science.">Evidence and Cognition</a></strong>, <em>Erkenntnis</em> 89:1927-1948, 2024. <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10670-022-00611-0.pdf"><img class="alignnone" src="images/openaccess.jpg" alt="" width="44" height="16" border="0" /><img class="alignnone" src="images/acrobat.gif" alt="" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a> doi: <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10670-022-00611-0">10.1007/s10670-022-00611-0</a>

We focus on CRTs testing the efficacy of non-pharmaceutical interventions. As one example, we use the case of school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic. In Norway, a cluster randomized trial was suggested and promoted as necessary for providing the best evidence to inform pandemic management policy. However, the proposal was rejected by the Norwegian Research Ethics Committee since it would violate the requirement for individual informed consent. This sparked debate about whether ethics stand in the way of evidence-based health policy, since the Norwegian Research Ethics law’s strict requirements for individual consent make it practically impossible to carry out CRTs of public health interventions. We argue that, in the case of the school closure trial, the suggested CRT would not have eliminated an epistemic gap and thus would not have justified the violation of consent rights. First, we focus on the methodological challenges to estimating quantifiable effects of school closures in the specific case of an airborne infectious disease. Second, in line with Evidential Pluralism, we highlight the value of alternative lines of evidence for informing school closure policy in a pandemic. In general, we propose that a trial requiring the waiver of participants’ consent rights must be highly likely to eliminate an epistemic gap. We elaborate on the practical aspects of this criterion and discuss the potential advantages of adding it to the Ottawa Statement on the Ethical Design and Conduct of Cluster Randomized Trials.">Individual consent in cluster randomised trials for non-pharmaceutical interventions: Going beyond the Ottawa Statement</a></strong>, <em>Critical Public Health</em> 34(1): 2338074, 2024. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/09581596.2024.2338074"><img class="alignnone" src="images/openaccess.jpg" alt="" width="44" height="16" border="0" /><img class="alignnone" src="images/acrobat.gif" alt="" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a> doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/09581596.2024.2338074">10.1080/09581596.2024.2338074</a></p>

Taylor &amp; Jon Williamson</span>:<strong> <a title="The epistemic theory of causality views causality as a tool that helps us to predict, explain and control our world, rather than as a relation that exists independently of our epistemic practices. In this chapter, we first provide an introduction to the epistemic theory of causality. We then outline four considerations that motivate the epistemic theory: the failure of standard theories of causality; parsimony; the epistemology of causality; and neutrality. We illustrate these four considerations in the contexts of the social sciences and the cognitive sciences. We argue that the epistemic theory provides a very natural account of causality across these contexts.">Epistemic causality and its application to the social and cognitive sciences</a></strong>, in Y.

<span style="color: #993300">Jon Williamson</span>: <strong><a title="Edwin Jaynes’ principle of maximum entropy holds that one should use the probability distribution with maximum entropy, from all those that fit the evidence, to draw inferences, because that is the distribution that is maximally non-committal with respect to propositions that are underdetermined by the evidence. The principle was widely applied in the years following its introduction in 1957, and in 1978 Jaynes took stock, writing the paper ‘Where do we stand on maximum entropy?’ to present his view of the state of the art. Jaynes’ principle needs to be generalised to a principle of maximal entropy if it is to be applied to first-order inductive logic, where there may be no unique maximum entropy function. The development of this objective Bayesian inductive logic has also been very fertile and it is the task of this chapter to take stock. The chapter provides an introduction to the logic and its motivation, explaining how it overcomes some problems with Carnap’s approach to inductive logic and with the subjective Bayesian approach. It also describes a range of recent results that shed light on features of the logic, its robustness and its decidability, as well as methods for performing inference in the logic.">Where do we stand on maximal entropy? </a></strong>In <em>Logic for data, </em>eds Hykel Hosni &amp; Juergen Landes, Springer, 2024. <a href="/documents/MaximalEntropy.pdf"><img class="alignnone" src="/images/acrobat.gif" alt="" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a>

<span style="color: #800000">Jon Williamson: </span><strong><a title="Bayesian philosophy and Bayesian statistics have diverged in recent years, because Bayesian philosophers have become more interested in philosophical problems other than the foundations of statistics and Bayesian statisticians have become less concerned with philosophical foundations. One way in which this divergence manifests itself is through the use of direct inference principles: Bayesian philosophers routinely advocate principles that require calibration of degrees of belief to available non-epistemic probabilities, while Bayesian statisticians rarely invoke such principles. As I explain, however, the standard Bayesian framework cannot coherently employ direct inference principles. Direct inference requires a shift towards a non-standard Bayesian framework, which further increases the gap between Bayesian philosophy and Bayesian statistics. This divergence does not preclude the application of Bayesian philosophical methods to real-world problems. Data consolidation is a key challenge for present-day systems medicine and other systems sciences. I show that data consolidation requires direct inference and that the non-standard Bayesian methods outlined here are well suited to this task.">Bayesianism from a philosophical perspective and its application to medicine</a></strong>, <em>International Journal of Biostatistics </em>19(2): 295-307, 2023. <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/ijb-2022-0043/pdf"><img class="alignnone" src="images/openaccess.jpg" alt="" width="44" height="16" border="0" /><img class="alignnone" src="images/acrobat.gif" alt="" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a> doi: <a href="http://doi.org/10.1515/ijb-2022-0043"><span class="" data-seleniumid="article-doi-text">10.1515/ijb-2022-0043</span></a>

<span style="color: #800000">Juergen Landes, Soroush Rafiee Rad and Jon Williamson: </span><strong><a title="According to the objective Bayesian approach to inductive logic, premisses inductively entail a conclusion just when every probability function with maximal entropy, from all those that satisfy the premisses, satisfies the conclusion. When premisses and conclusion are constraints on probabilities of sentences of a first-order predicate language, however, it is by no means obvious how to determine these maximal entropy functions. This paper makes progress on the problem in the following ways. Firstly, we introduce the concept of a limit in entropy and show that, if the set of probability functions satisfying the premisses contains a limit in entropy, then this limit point is unique and is the maximal entropy probability function. Next, we turn to the special case in which the premisses are categorical sentences of the logical language. We show that if the uniform probability function gives the premisses positive probability, then the maximal entropy function can be found by simply conditionalising this uniform prior on the premisses. We generalise our results to demonstrate agreement between the maximal entropy approach and Jeffrey conditionalisation in the case in which there is a single premiss that specifies the probability of a sentence of the language. We show that, after learning such a premiss, certain inferences are preserved, namely inferences to inductive tautologies. Finally, we consider potential pathologies of the approach: we explore the extent to which the maximal entropy approach is invariant under permutations of the constants of the language, and we discuss some cases in which there is no maximal entropy probability function.">Determining maximal entropy functions for objective Bayesian inductive logic</a></strong>, <em>Journal of Philosophical Logic</em> 52:555-608, 2023.  <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10992-022-09680-6.pdf"><img class="alignnone" src="/images/openaccess.jpg" alt="" width="44" height="16" border="0" /><img class="alignnone" src="/images/acrobat.gif" alt="" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a> doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10992-022-09680-6">10.1007/s10992-022-09680-6</a>

<span style="color: #993300">Jon Williamson</span>: <strong><a title="Schurz (2019, Chapter 4) argues that probabilistic accounts of induction fail. In particular, he criticises probabilistic accounts of induction that appeal to direct inference principles, including subjective Bayesian approaches (e.g., Howson, 2000) and objective Bayesian approaches (see, e.g., Williamson, 2017). In this paper, I argue that Schurz’ preferred direct inference principle, namely Reichenbach’s Principle of the Narrowest Reference Class, faces formidable problems in a standard probabilistic setting. Furthermore, the main alternative direct inference principle, Lewis’ Principal Principle, is also hard to reconcile with standard probabilism. So, I argue, standard probabilistic approaches cannot appeal to direct inference to explicate the logic of induction. However, I go on to defend a non-standard objective Bayesian account of induction: I argue that this approach can both accommodate direct inference and provide a viable account of the logic of induction. I then defend this account against Schurz’ criticisms.">Direct inference and probabilistic accounts of induction</a></strong>, <em>Journal for General Philosophy of Science</em> <span dir="ltr" role="presentation"> 54:451–472</span>, 2023. <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10838-021-09584-0.pdf"><img class="alignnone" src="images/openaccess.jpg" alt="" width="44" height="16" border="0" /><img class="alignnone" src="images/acrobat.gif" alt="" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a> <a href="documents/ProbabilisticInduction.pdf"><img id="IMG47" class="alignnone" src="images/acrobat.gif" alt="" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a> . doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10838-021-09584-0">10.1007/s10838-021-09584-0</a>

<span style="color: #800000">Juergen Landes and Jon Williamson: </span><strong><a title="This paper addresses a data integration problem: given several mutually consistent datasets each of which measures a subset of the variables of interest, how can one construct a probabilistic model that fits the data and gives reasonable answers to questions which are under-determined by the data? Here we show how to obtain a Bayesian network model which represents the unique probability function that agrees with the probability distributions measured by the datasets and otherwise has maximum entropy. We provide a general algorithm, OBN-cDS, which offers substantial efficiency savings over the standard brute-force approach to determining the maximum entropy probability function. Furthermore, we develop modifications to the general algorithm which enable further efficiency savings but which are only applicable in particular situations. We show that there are circumstances in which one can obtain the model (i) directly from the data; (ii) by solving algebraic problems; and (iii) by solving relatively simple independent optimisation problems.">Objective Bayesian nets for integrating consistent datasets</a></strong>, <em>Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research</em> 74: 393-458, 2022. <a href="https://jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/13363/26805"><img class="alignnone" src="/images/openaccess.jpg" alt="" width="44" height="16" border="0" /><img class="alignnone" src="/images/acrobat.gif" alt="" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a>. doi <a href="https://doi.org/10.1613/jair.1.13363">10.1613/jair.1.13363</a>

The problem is that philosophical arguments become mere *pantomemes*: arguments that are reasonable to resist simply by denying the conclusion. I show that appeals to proof, intuition, evidence and truth fail to alleviate the problem. However, I develop two broad strategies that do help in certain circumstances: an appeal to *normal informal standards of what is reasonable* (nisowir) and *argument by interpretation*. The method of explication features prominently in both strategies, and I extend this method to apply to nisowir, introducing the concept of *canonical explication*. I illustrate the two strategies with examples of arguments from formal epistemology, and I suggest that an appeal to nisowir might help to defend against philosophical scepticism by shifting the burden of proof to the sceptic.">One philosopher's modus ponens is another's modus tollens: pantomemes and nisowir</a></strong>, <em>Metaphilosophy</em> 53:284-304, 2022. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/meta.12546"><img class="alignnone" src="images/openaccess.jpg" alt="" width="44" height="16" border="0" /><img class="alignnone" src="images/acrobat.gif" alt="" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a> <a href="documents/MPMT.pdf"><img id="IMG47" class="alignnone" src="images/acrobat.gif" alt="" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a> . doi: <a href="http://doi.org/10.1111/meta.12546"><span class="" data-seleniumid="article-doi-text">10.1111/meta.12546</span></a></p>
