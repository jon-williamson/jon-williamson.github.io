But what should science-friendly epistemology (SFE) look like? In this paper I put forward and discuss five desiderata. (i) SFE should be grounded in real scientific practice: it should be motivated by and able to cope with the complexities of real science. (ii) SFE should avoid ‘metaphysical bias’, i.e., metaphysical presuppositions that constrain the search space of epistemological theories, potentially leading to implausible claims about science or sub-optimal scientific methods. Yet it should not be merely descriptive: (iii) SFE should offer the potential to improve scientific practice. On the other hand, it shouldn’t be too revisionary with respect to the conceptual core of science: (iv) SFE should generally appeal to concepts with which scientists are familiar and use them in the ways in which they are used in science. Finally, (v) SFE should focus more on cases that are typical or important in science and less on far-fetched putative counterexamples. I then consider Evidential Pluralism as a potential exemplar of science-friendly epistemology. Evidential Pluralism is a specific theory of the epistemology of causality: according to Evidential Pluralism, establishing causation requires establishing both the existence of a correlation and the existence of a mechanism, and assessing causation requires assessing mechanistic studies alongside association studies. After introducing this epistemological theory, I argue that it meets all five desiderata for SFE.

Decidability is achieved by reducing the general inference problem to a quantifier-free problem. We show that for any inference, if the quantifier-free reduction of the premisses is satisfiable, then the original inference is decidable.  We go on to show that Bayesian networks offer the potential to provide a computationally tractable inference procedure for objective Bayesian inductive logic. We also consider inferences with infinitely many premisses and explore some properties of the logic.">A decidable class of inferences in first-order objective Bayesian inductive logic</a></strong>, <em>Annals of Pure and Applied Logic</em> in press.  

<span style="color: #800000">Jon Williamson: </span><strong><a title="I provide an example in which Bayesian conditionalisation fails to validate plausible claims about rational permissibility. The example suggests that conditionalisation should be treated as a heuristic principle: useful in many situations, but not all. This raises the question of how to characterise the cases in which it is appropriate to use conditionalisation. I show that one can answer this question by appealing to the framework of objective Bayesian inductive logic to provide sufficient conditions for the applicability of conditionalisation.">The heuristic use of conditionalisation</a></strong>, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/analysis"><em>Analysis</em></a>. <a href="/publications/documents/heuristic.pdf"><img class="alignnone" src="/images/acrobat.gif" alt="" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a> Doi <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/analys/anaf094">10.1093/analys/anaf094.</a>

Contrary to Bogen and Woodward's rejection of data-to-theory and theory-to-data inferences/predictions, we draw upon artificial intelligence as applied to science literature to argue that (a) many models are routinely inferred and predicted from the data and routinely used to infer and predict data, and (b) such models can, at least in some contexts, play the role of theories.">The Interplay of data, models, and theories in machine learning</a></strong>, <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/philosophy-of-science"><em>Philosophy of Science</em></a>. <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/E6F197A54A93C3D597F1568A9EEB3B39/S003182482510161Xa.pdf/the-interplay-of-data-models-and-theories-in-machine-learning.pdf"><img class="alignnone" src="/images/acrobat.gif" alt="" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a> Doi <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/psa.2025.10161">10.1017/psa.2025.10161.</a>

<span style="color: #800000">Alexandra Trofimov and Jon Williamson: </span><strong><a title="Evidence-based law seeks to make best use of evidence to assess the effectiveness of laws and regulations. The question arises as to how exactly to make best use of evidence. This paper argues that Evidential Pluralism provides an answer to this question, and can thus provide philosophical foundations for evidence-based law. Evidential Pluralism is a theory of causal enquiry which maintains that one needs to scrutinise mechanistic studies alongside the experimental and observational studies that are the focus of present-day evidence-based medicine and evidence-based policy. The paper develops a new approach to evidence-based law, called EBL+, based on the principles of Evidential Pluralism. Three examples show how the proposed methods work: banning hand-held mobile phone use while driving, sugar tax, and face-mask mandates for controlling Covid-19.">Applying Evidential Pluralism to evidence-based law: EBL+</a></strong>, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/rjpn20"><em>Jurisprudence</em></a>.  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/20403313.2025.2449758"><img class="alignnone" src="/images/openaccess.jpg" alt="" width="44" height="16" border="0" /><img class="alignnone" src="/images/acrobat.gif" alt="" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a> <!--  <a href="/publications/documents/IBE-Bayesianism.pdf"><img class="alignnone" src="images/acrobat.gif" alt="" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a> --> Doi <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/20403313.2025.2449758">10.1080/20403313.2025.</a>

<span style="color: #800000">Jon Williamson: </span><strong><a title="In this paper I counter Alexander Bird’s claim that Bayesian probabilities ought to be informed by explanatory considerations. Bird (2022) invokes an argument of Michael Huemer to conclude that inductive inference requires
explanatory constraints on prior probabilities. I suggest that this argument is unsuccessful, on account of its appeal to David Lewis’ Principal Principle. Bird
goes on to interpret the probabilities in Bayes’ theorem other than the prior as a measure of how well a hypothesis explains the evidence. I show that this
interpretation faces a new version of the old evidence problem.">Explanationist constraints on rational degrees of belief</a></strong>, <a href="http://www.filosofiskanotiser.com/aktuelltnummer.htm"><em>Filosofiska Notiser</em></a> 12(1):25-37, 2025.  <a href="http://www.filosofiskanotiser.com/Williamson.pdf"><img class="alignnone" src="images/openaccess.jpg" alt="" width="44" height="16" border="0" /><img class="alignnone" src="images/acrobat.gif" alt="" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a>  <!-- <a href="/publications/documents/IBE-Bayesianism.pdf"><img class="alignnone" src="images/acrobat.gif" alt="" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a> -->

<span style="color: #800000">Samuel D. Taylor and Jon Williamson: </span><strong><a title="Cognitive theorists routinely disagree about the evidence supporting claims in cognitive science. Here, we first argue that some disagreements about evidence in cognitive science are about the evidence available to be drawn upon by cognitive theorists. Then, we show that one's explanation of why this first kind of disagreement obtains will cohere with one's theory of evidence. We argue that the best explanation for why cognitive theorists disagree in this way is because their evidence is what they rationally grant. Finally, we explain why our view does not lead to a pernicious kind of relativism in cognitive science.">Evidence and Cognition</a></strong>, <em>Erkenntnis</em> 89:1927-1948, 2024. <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10670-022-00611-0.pdf"><img class="alignnone" src="images/openaccess.jpg" alt="" width="44" height="16" border="0" /><img class="alignnone" src="images/acrobat.gif" alt="" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a> doi: <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10670-022-00611-0">10.1007/s10670-022-00611-0</a>

<p data-wp-editing="1"><span style="color: #993300">Marissa LeBlanc, Jon Williamson, Francesco De Pretis, Juergen Landes &amp; Elena Rocca: </span><strong><a title="This paper discusses the issue of overriding the right of individual consent to participation in cluster randomised trials (CRTs). We focus on CRTs testing the efficacy of non-pharmaceutical interventions. As one example, we use the case of school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic. In Norway, a cluster randomized trial was suggested and promoted as necessary for providing the best evidence to inform pandemic management policy. However, the proposal was rejected by the Norwegian Research Ethics Committee since it would violate the requirement for individual informed consent. This sparked debate about whether ethics stand in the way of evidence-based health policy, since the Norwegian Research Ethics law’s strict requirements for individual consent make it practically impossible to carry out CRTs of public health interventions. We argue that, in the case of the school closure trial, the suggested CRT would not have eliminated an epistemic gap and thus would not have justified the violation of consent rights. First, we focus on the methodological challenges to estimating quantifiable effects of school closures in the specific case of an airborne infectious disease. Second, in line with Evidential Pluralism, we highlight the value of alternative lines of evidence for informing school closure policy in a pandemic. In general, we propose that a trial requiring the waiver of participants’ consent rights must be highly likely to eliminate an epistemic gap. We elaborate on the practical aspects of this criterion and discuss the potential advantages of adding it to the Ottawa Statement on the Ethical Design and Conduct of Cluster Randomized Trials.">Individual consent in cluster randomised trials for non-pharmaceutical interventions: Going beyond the Ottawa Statement</a></strong>, <em>Critical Public Health</em> 34(1): 2338074, 2024. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/09581596.2024.2338074"><img class="alignnone" src="images/openaccess.jpg" alt="" width="44" height="16" border="0" /><img class="alignnone" src="images/acrobat.gif" alt="" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a> doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/09581596.2024.2338074">10.1080/09581596.2024.2338074</a></p>

<span style="color: #993300">Yafeng Shan, Samuel D. Taylor &amp; Jon Williamson</span>:<strong> <a title="The epistemic theory of causality views causality as a tool that helps us to predict, explain and control our world, rather than as a relation that exists independently of our epistemic practices. In this chapter, we first provide an introduction to the epistemic theory of causality. We then outline four considerations that motivate the epistemic theory: the failure of standard theories of causality; parsimony; the epistemology of causality; and neutrality. We illustrate these four considerations in the contexts of the social sciences and the cognitive sciences. We argue that the epistemic theory provides a very natural account of causality across these contexts.">Epistemic causality and its application to the social and cognitive sciences</a></strong>, in Y.

<span style="color: #993300">Jon Williamson</span>: <strong><a title="Edwin Jaynes’ principle of maximum entropy holds that one should use the probability distribution with maximum entropy, from all those that fit the evidence, to draw inferences, because that is the distribution that is maximally non-committal with respect to propositions that are underdetermined by the evidence. The principle was widely applied in the years following its introduction in 1957, and in 1978 Jaynes took stock, writing the paper ‘Where do we stand on maximum entropy?’ to present his view of the state of the art. Jaynes’ principle needs to be generalised to a principle of maximal entropy if it is to be applied to first-order inductive logic, where there may be no unique maximum entropy function. The development of this objective Bayesian inductive logic has also been very fertile and it is the task of this chapter to take stock. The chapter provides an introduction to the logic and its motivation, explaining how it overcomes some problems with Carnap’s approach to inductive logic and with the subjective Bayesian approach. It also describes a range of recent results that shed light on features of the logic, its robustness and its decidability, as well as methods for performing inference in the logic.">Where do we stand on maximal entropy? </a></strong>In <em>Perspectives on logics for data-driven reasoning, </em>eds Hykel Hosni &amp; Juergen Landes, Springer, 2024, pp. 39-61. <a href="/documents/MaximalEntropy.pdf"><img class="alignnone" src="/images/acrobat.gif" alt="" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a> doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-77892-6_3">10.1007/978-3-031-77892-6_3</a>
