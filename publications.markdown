<span style="color: #800000">Yafeng Shan and Jon Williamson</span>: <strong><a title="This volume contends that Evidential Pluralism - an account of the epistemology of causation, which maintains that in order to establish a causal claim one needs to establish the existence of a correlation and the existence of a mechanism - can be fruitfully applied to the social sciences. Through case studies in sociology, economics, political science and law, it advances new philosophical foundations for causal enquiry in the social sciences. The book provides an account of how to establish and evaluate causal claims and it offers a new way of thinking about evidence-based policy, basic social science research and mixed methods research. As such, it will appeal to scholars with interests in social science research and methodology, the philosophy of science and evidence-based policy.">Evidential Pluralism in the Social Sciences</a></strong>, <span data-wp-editing="1">Routledge 2023. <a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9780367697228"><img class="alignnone" src="../images/openaccess.jpg" alt="" width="44" height="16" border="0" /><img class="alignnone" src="../images/acrobat.gif" alt="" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a> <span class="meta">ISBN <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Evidential-Pluralism-in-the-Social-Sciences/Shan-Williamson/p/book/9780367697228">9780367697228 </a></span></span>

<p>Daniel Auker-Howlett and Jon Williamson: <strong><a title="As the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated, barriers to vaccination uptake are heterogeneous and vary according to the local context. We argue that a more systematic consideration of local social and behavioural mechanisms could improve the development, assessment and refinement of vaccination uptake interventions. The EBM+ approach to evidence appraisal, which is a development of a recent line of work on the epistemology of causality, provides a means to evaluate mechanistic studies and their role in assessing the effectiveness of an intervention. We argue that an EBM+ methodology offers several potential benefits for research on vaccination uptake interventions. It also motivates the use of detailed mechanistic models, rather than the high-level logic models used by process evaluations, for example.">Vaccination uptake interventions: an EBM+ approach</a></strong>, <em>Argumenta</em> 7(1): 79-96, 2021. <a href="https://www.argumenta.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/4-Argumenta-7-1-Daniel-Auker-Howlett-and-Jon-Williamson-Vaccination-Uptake-Interventions.pdf"><img class="alignnone" src="../images/openaccess.jpg" alt="" width="44" height="16" border="0" /><img class="alignnone" src="../images/acrobat.gif" alt="" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a> . doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.14275/2465-2334/202113.auk">10.14275/2465-2334/202113.auk</a> </p>

<p>Yafeng Shan and Jon Williamson: <strong><a title="Evidential Pluralism maintains that in order to establish a causal claim one normally needs to establish the existence of an appropriate conditional correlation and the existence of an appropriate mechanism complex, so when assessing a causal claim one ought to consider both association studies and mechanistic studies. Hitherto, Evidential Pluralism has been applied to medicine, leading to the EBM+ programme, which recommends that evidence-based medicine should systematically evaluate mechanistic studies alongside clinical studies. This paper argues that Evidential Pluralism can also be fruitfully applied to the social sciences. In particular, Evidential Pluralism provides (i) a new approach to evidence-based policy; (ii) a new account of the evidential relationships in more theoretical research; and (iii) new philosophical motivation for mixed methods research. The application of Evidential Pluralism to the social sciences is also defended against two objections.">Applying Evidential Pluralism to the social sciences</a></strong>, <em>European Journal for the Philosophy of Science</em> 11(4):96, 2021. <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13194-021-00415-z.pdf"><img class="alignnone" src="../images/openaccess.jpg" alt="" width="44" height="16" border="0" /><img class="alignnone" src="../images/acrobat.gif" alt="" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a> <a href="https://blogs.kent.ac.uk/jonw/files/2021/09/EPSocSci.pdf"><img id="IMG47" class="alignnone" src="../images/acrobat.gif" alt="" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a> . doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s13194-021-00415-z">10.1007/s13194-021-00415-z</a></p>

<p>Jeffrey K. Aronson, Daniel Auker-Howlett, Virginia Ghiara, Michael P. Kelly and Jon Williamson: <strong><a title="Evidence-based medicine (EBM), the dominant approach to assessing the effectiveness of clinical and public health interventions, focuses on the results of association studies. EBM+ is a development of EBM that systematically considers mechanistic studies alongside association studies. In this paper we provide several examples of the importance of mechanistic evidence to coronavirus research. (i) Assessment of combination therapy for MERS highlights the need for systematic assessment of mechanistic evidence. (ii) That hypertension is a risk factor for severe disease in the case of SARS-CoV-2 suggests that altering hypertension treatment might alleviate disease, but the mechanisms are complex, and it is essential to consider and evaluate multiple mechanistic hypotheses. (iii) To be confident that public health interventions will be effective requires a detailed assessment of social and psychological components of the mechanisms of their action, in addition to mechanisms of disease. (iv) In particular, if vaccination programmes are to be effective, they must be carefully tailored to the social context; again, mechanistic evidence is crucial. We conclude that coronavirus research is best situated within the EBM+ evaluation framework.">The use of mechanistic reasoning in assessing coronavirus interventions</a></strong>, <em>Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice</em> 27(3): 684-693, 2021. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jep.13438"><img class="alignnone" src="../images/openaccess.jpg" alt="" width="44" height="16" border="0" /><img class="alignnone" src="../images/acrobat.gif" alt="" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a> . doi: <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jep.13438">10.1111/jep.13438</a></p>

<p>Jon Williamson: <strong><a title="The EBM+ programme is an attempt to improve the way in which present-day evidence-based medicine (EBM) assesses causal claims: according to EBM+, mechanistic studies should be scrutinised alongside association studies. This paper addresses two worries about EBM+: (i) that it is not feasible in practice, and (ii) that it is too malleable, i.e., its results depend on subjective choices that need to be made in order to implement the procedure. Several responses to these two worries are considered and evaluated. The paper also discusses the question of whether we should have confidence in medical interventions, in the light of Stegenga’s arguments for medical nihilism.">The feasibility and malleability of EBM+</a></strong>, <em>Theoria</em> 36(2):191-209, 2021. <a href="https://www.ehu.eus/ojs/index.php/THEORIA/article/download/21244/19461"><img class="alignnone" src="../images/openaccess.jpg" alt="" width="44" height="16" border="0" /><img class="alignnone" src="../images/acrobat.gif" alt="" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a> <a href="https://blogs.kent.ac.uk/jonw/files/2021/04/FeasibilityMalleability.pdf"><img id="IMG47" class="alignnone" src="../images/acrobat.gif" alt="" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a> doi: <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1387/theoria.21244">10.1387/theoria.21244</a></p>

<p>Jon Williamson: <strong><a title="The epistemic theory of causality is analogous to epistemic theories of probability. Most proponents of epistemic probability would argue that one's degrees of belief should be calibrated to chances, insofar as one has evidence of chances. The question arises as to whether causal beliefs should satisfy an analogous calibration norm. In this paper, I formulate a particular version of a norm requiring calibration to chances and argue that this norm is the most fundamental evidential norm for epistemic probability. I then develop an analogous calibration norm for epistemic causality, argue that it is the *only* evidential norm required for epistemic causality, and show how an epistemic account of causality that incorporates this norm can be used to analyse objective causal relationships.">Calibration for epistemic causality</a></strong>, <em>Erkenntnis</em> 86(4):941-960, 2021. <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10670-019-00139-w.pdf"><img class="alignnone" src="../images/openaccess.jpg" alt="" width="44" height="16" border="0" /></a><a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10670-019-00139-w.pdf"><img class="alignnone" src="../images/acrobat.gif" alt="" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a> <a href="https://blogs.kent.ac.uk/jonw/files/2019/06/CalibrationEC.pdf"><img id="IMG47" class="alignnone" src="../images/acrobat.gif" alt="" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a> doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10670-019-00139-w">10.1007/s10670-019-00139-w</a></p>

<p>Jon Williamson: <strong><a title="The teratogenicity of the Zika virus was considered established in 2016, and is an interesting case because three different sets of causal criteria were used to assess teratogenicity. This paper appeals to the thesis of Russo and Williamson (2007) to devise an epistemological framework that can be used to compare and evaluate sets of causal criteria. The framework can also be used to decide when enough criteria are satisfied to establish causality. Arguably, the three sets of causal criteria considered here offer only a rudimentary assessment of mechanistic studies, and some suggestions are made as to alternative ways to establish causality.">Establishing the teratogenicity of Zika and evaluating causal criteria</a></strong>, <em>Synthese</em> 198(10): 2505–2518, 2021. <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11229-018-1866-9.pdf?pdf=button"><img class="alignnone" src="../images/openaccess.jpg" alt="" width="44" height="16" border="0" /></a><a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11229-018-1866-9.pdf?pdf=button"><img class="alignnone" src="../images/acrobat.gif" alt="" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a> <a href="https://blogs.kent.ac.uk/jonw/files/2018/06/zika.pdf"><img id="IMG47" class="alignnone" src="../images/acrobat.gif" alt="" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a> doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11229-018-1866-9">10.1007/s11229-018-1866-9</a></p>

This article presents the key features of the updated Preamble, a major milestone that will enable IARC to take advantage of recent scientific and procedural advances made during the 12 years since the last Preamble amendments. The updated Preamble formalizes important developments already being pioneered in the Monographs Programme. These developments were taken forward in a clarified and strengthened process for identifying, reviewing, evaluating and integrating evidence to identify causes of human cancer. The advancements adopted include strengthening of systematic review methodologies; greater emphasis on mechanistic evidence, based on key characteristics of carcinogens; greater consideration of quality and informativeness in the critical evaluation of epidemiological studies, including their exposure assessment methods; improved harmonization of evaluation criteria for the different evidence streams; and a single-step process of integrating evidence on cancer in humans, cancer in experimental animals and mechanisms for reaching overall evaluations. In all, the updated Preamble underpins a stronger and more transparent method for the identification of carcinogenic hazards, the essential first step in cancer prevention.">The IARC Monographs: Updated procedures for modern and transparent evidence synthesis in cancer hazard identification</a></strong>, <em>Journal of the National Cancer Institute </em>112(1):30-37, 2020. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jnci/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/jnci/djz169/29964068/djz169.pdf"><img class="alignnone" src="../images/openaccess.jpg" alt="" width="44" height="16" border="0" /></a><a href="https://academic.oup.com/jnci/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/jnci/djz169/29964068/djz169.pdf"><img class="alignnone" src="../images/acrobat.gif" alt="" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a> doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jnci/djz169">10.1093/jnci/djz169</a></p>

While science textbooks tend to offer qualitative models of mechanisms, there is increasing demand for models from which one can draw quantitative predictions and explanations. Casini et al.

The RBN formalism is an extension of the standard Bayesian net formalism, an extension that allows for modelling the hierarchical nature of mechanisms. Like the standard Bayesian net formalism, it models causal relationships using directed acyclic graphs. Given this appeal to acyclicity, causal cycles pose a prima facie problem for the RBN approach.

Second, evidence of mechanisms is often required in order to obtain evidence of correlation (for example, in order to set up and evaluate RCTs).

According to the epistemic approach, causal claims tell us about which inferences (e.g., diagnoses and prognoses) are appropriate, rather than about the presence of some physical causal relation analogous to distance or gravitational attraction. It is shown that the epistemic theory has important consequences for medical practice, in particular with regard to the evidence based causal assessment.">Epistemic causality and evidence-based medicine</a></strong>, <em>History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences</em> 33(4):563-582, 2011. <a href="https://blogs.kent.ac.uk/jonw/files/2015/03/epcause-medicine2011.pdf"><img id="IMG28" src="../images/acrobat.gif" alt="" border="0" /></a></p>

<p>George Darby and Jon Williamson: <strong><a title="Russo and Williamson (2007) put forward the thesis that, at least in the health sciences, to establish the claim that C is a cause of E one normally needs evidence of an underlying mechanism linking C and E as well as evidence that C makes a difference to E. This epistemological thesis poses a problem for most current analyses of causality which, in virtue of analysing causality in terms of just one of mechanisms or difference making, cannot account for the need for the other kind of evidence. Weber (2009) has suggested to the contrary that Giere’s probabilistic analysis of causality survives this criticism. In this paper we respond to Weber’s suggestion, arguing that Giere’s account does not survive the criticism, and we look in detail at the case of medical imaging technology, which, we argue, supports the thesis of Russo and Williamson (2007).">Imaging Technology and the Philosophy of Causality</a></strong>, <em>Philosophy and Technology</em> 24(2): 115-136, 2011. <a href="https://www.springerlink.com/content/376j74k283161p4r/fulltext.pdf"><img id="IMG16" src="../images/acrobat.gif" alt="" border="0" /></a> <a href="https://blogs.kent.ac.uk/jonw/files/2015/03/ImagingCausality2011.pdf"><img id="IMG37" src="../images/acrobat.gif" alt="" border="0" /></a></p>

One question is epistemological: can relationships at one level be evidence for relationships at the other level? We present three kinds of answer to this question, categorised according to whether inference is top-down, bottom-up, or the levels are independent. A second question is metaphysical: can relationships at one level be reduced to relationships at the other level? We present three kinds of answer to this second question, categorised according to whether single-case relations are reduced to generic, generic relations are reduced to single-case, or the levels are independent. We then explore causal inference in autopsy. This is an interesting case study, we argue, because it refutes all three epistemologies and all three metaphysics.

We identify three core elements of mechanistic explanation: functional individuation, hierarchical nestedness or decomposition, and organization. These are now well understood elements of mechanistic explanation in fields such as protein synthesis, and widely accepted in the mechanisms literature. But Skipper and Millstein have argued (2005) that natural selection is neither decomposable nor organized. This would mean that much of the current mechanisms literature does not apply to the mechanism of natural selection. We take each element of mechanistic explanation in turn. Having appreciated the importance of functional individuation, we show how decomposition and organization should be better understood in these terms. We thereby show that mechanistic explanation by protein synthesis and natural selection are more closely analogous than they appear – both possess all three of these core elements of a mechanism widely recognized in the mechanisms literature.">Function and organization: comparing the mechanisms of protein synthesis and natural selection</a></strong>, <em>Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences</em> 41, pp. 279-291, 2010, doi 10.1016/j.shpsc.2010.07.001; <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.shpsc.2010.07.001"><img id="IMG14" src="../images/acrobat.gif" alt="" border="0" /></a>; <a href="https://blogs.kent.ac.uk/jonw/files/2015/03/FunctionOrganisation2010.pdf"><img id="IMG15" src="../images/acrobat.gif" alt="" border="0" /></a></p>

<p>Jon Williamson:<strong> <a style="color: #21759b" title="&gt;It is tempting to analyse causality in terms of just one of the indicators of causal relationships, e.g., mechanisms, probabilistic dependencies or independencies, counterfactual conditionals or agency considerations. While such an analysis will surely shed light on some aspect of our concept of cause, it will fail to capture the whole, rather multifarious, notion. So one might instead plump for pluralism: a different analysis for a different occasion. But we do not seem to have lots of different concepts of cause - just one eclectic notion. The resolution of this conundrum, I think, requires us to accept that our causal beliefs are generated by a wide variety of indicators, but to deny that this variety of indicators yields a variety of concepts of cause. This focus on the relation between evidence and causal beliefs leads to what I call *epistemic* causality. Under this view, certain causal beliefs are appropriate or rational on the basis of observed evidence; our notion of cause can be understood purely in terms of these rational beliefs. Causality, then, is a feature of our epistemic representation of the world, rather than of the world itself. This yields one, multifaceted notion of cause.">Causal pluralism versus epistemic causality</a></strong>, <em>Philosophica</em> 77(1), pp. 69-96, 2006; <a href="https://logica.ugent.be/philosophica/fulltexts/77-4.pdf"><img src="../images/acrobat.gif" alt="" border="0" /></a><a href="https://blogs.kent.ac.uk/jonw/files/2015/03/plurality2008.pdf"><img src="../images/acrobat.gif" alt="" border="0" /></a></p>

I argue that Nancy Cartwright's dispositional account of causality goes part way towards meeting these criteria but is lacking in important respects. I go on to argue that my epistemic account, which ties causal relationships to an agent's knowledge and ignorance, performs well in the light of the desiderata.

<p>Juergen Landes, Soroush Rafiee Rad and Jon Williamson: <strong><a title="The maximum entropy principle is widely used to determine non-committal probabilities on a finite domain, subject to a set of constraints, but its application to continuous domains is notoriously problematic. This paper concerns an intermediate case, where the domain is a first-order predicate language. Two strategies have been put forward for applying the maximum entropy principle on such a domain: (i) applying it to finite sublanguages and taking the pointwise limit of the resulting probabilities as the size n of the sublanguage increases; (ii) selecting a probability function on the language as a whole whose entropy on finite sublanguages of size n is not dominated by that of any other probability function for sufficiently large n. The entropy-limit conjecture says that, where these two approaches yield determinate probabilities, the two methods yield the same probabilities. If this conjecture is found to be true, it would provide a boost to the project of seeking a single canonical inductive logic—a project which faltered when Carnap’s attempts in this direction succeeded only in determining a continuum of inductive methods. The truth of the conjecture would also boost the project of providing a canonical characterisation of normal or default models of first-order theories. Hitherto, the entropy-limit conjecture has been verified for languages which contain only unary predicate symbols and also for the case in which the constraints can be captured by a categorical statement of Σ 1 quantifier complexity. This paper shows that the entropy-limit conjecture also holds for categorical statements of Π 1 complexity, for various non-categorical constraints, and in certain other general situations.">Towards the Entropy-Limit Conjecture</a></strong>, <em>Annals of Pure and Applied Logic</em> 172(2):102870, 2021. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168007220300944/pdfft?isDTMRedir=true&amp;download=true"><img class="alignnone" src="../images/openaccess.jpg" alt="" width="44" height="16" border="0" /><img class="alignnone" src="../images/acrobat.gif" alt="" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a> . doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apal.2020.102870">10.1016/j.apal.2020.102870</a></p>

<p>Jon Williamson: <strong><a title="Expert probability forecasts can be useful for decision making (§1). But levels of uncertainty escalate: however the forecaster expresses the uncertainty that attaches to a forecast, there are good reasons for her to express a further level of uncertainty, in the shape of either imprecision or higher order uncertainty (§2). Bayesian epistemology provides the means to halt this escalator, by tying expressions of uncertainty to the propositions expressible in an agent’s language (§3). But Bayesian epistemology comes in three main varieties. Strictly subjective Bayesianism and empirically-based subjective Bayesianism have difficulty in justifying the use of a forecaster’s probabilities for decision making (§4). On the other hand, objective Bayesianism can justify the use of these probabilities, at least when the probabilities are consistent with the agent’s evidence (§5). Hence objective Bayesianism offers the most promise overall for explaining how testimony of uncertainty can be useful for decision making. Interestingly, the objective Bayesian analysis provided in §5 can also be used to justify a version of the Principle of Reflection (§6).">How uncertain do we need to be?</a></strong> <em>Erkenntnis</em> 79(6):1249-1271, 2014.

<p>Jürgen Landes &amp; Jon Williamson: <strong><a title="Objective Bayesian epistemology invokes three norms: the strengths of our beliefs should be probabilities, they should be calibrated to our evidence of physical probabilities, and they should otherwise equivocate sufficiently between the basic propositions that we can express. The three norms are sometimes explicated by appealing to the maximum entropy principle, which says that a belief function should be a probability function, from all those that are calibrated to evidence, that has maximum entropy. However, the three norms of objective Bayesianism are usually justified in different ways. In this paper we show that the three norms can all be subsumed under a single justification in terms of minimising worst-case expected loss. This, in turn, is equivalent to maximising a generalised notion of entropy. We suggest that requiring language invariance, in addition to minimising worst-case expected loss, motivates maximisation of standard entropy as opposed to maximisation of other instances of generalised entropy. Our argument also provides a qualified justification for updating degrees of belief by Bayesian conditionalisation. However, conditional probabilities play a less central part in the objective Bayesian account than they do under the subjective view of Bayesianism, leading to a reduced role for Bayes’ Theorem">Objective Bayesianism and the Maximum Entropy Principle</a></strong>, <em>Entropy</em> 15(9): 3528-3591, 2013. <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/15/9/3528/pdf"><img src="../images/openaccess.jpg" alt="" border="0" /><img src="../images/acrobat.gif" alt="" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a> doi:10.3390/e15093528</p>

<p>Jon Williamson: <strong><a title="Objective Bayesianism has been criticised on the grounds that objective Bayesian updating, which on a finite outcome space appeals to the maximum entropy principle, differs from Bayesian conditionalisation. The main task of this paper is to show that this objection backfires: the difference between the two forms of updating reflects negatively on Bayesian conditionalisation rather than on objective Bayesian updating. The paper also reviews some existing criticisms and justifications of conditionalisation, arguing in particular that the diachronic Dutch book justification fails because diachronic Dutch book arguments are subject to a reduction: in certain circumstances one can Dutch book an agent however she changes her degrees of belief. One may also criticise objective Bayesianism on the grounds that its norms are not compulsory but voluntary, the result of a stance.

I show how objective Bayesian nets can be constructed, updated and combined, and how they can deal with cases in which the agent's background knowledge includes knowledge of qualitative *influence relationships*, e.g. causal influences. I then sketch a number of applications of the resulting formalism, showing how it can shed light on probability logic, causal modelling, logical reasoning, semantic reasoning, argumentation and recursive modelling.">Objective Bayesian nets</a></strong>, in S.

<p>Jon Williamson: <strong><a title="Bayesian probability is normally defined over a fixed language or event space. But in practice language is susceptible to change, and the question naturally arises as to how Bayesian degrees of belief should change as language changes. I argue here that this question poses a serious challenge to Bayesianism. The Bayesian may be able to meet this challenge however, and I outline a practical method for changing degrees of belief over changes in finite propositional languages.">Bayesianism and language change</a></strong>, <em>Journal of Logic, Language and Information</em>, 12(1), 2003, pp. 53-97. <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023%2FA%3A1021128011190.pdf"><img src="../images/acrobat.gif" alt="" border="0" /></a> <a href="https://blogs.kent.ac.uk/jonw/files/2015/04/language_change2003.pdf"><img src="../images/acrobat.gif" alt="" border="0" /></a></p>

<p>Jung-Wook Bang, Raphael Chaleil &amp; Jon Williamson: <strong><a title="Metabolism is a set of chemical reactions, used by living organisms to process chemical compounds in order to take energy and eliminate toxic compounds, for example. Its processes are referred as metabolic pathways. Understanding metabolism is imperative to biology, toxicology and medicine, but the number and complexity of metabolic pathways makes this a difficult task. In our paper, we investigate the use of causal Bayesian networks to model the pathways of yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolism: such a network can be used to draw predictions about the levels of metabolites and enzymes in a particular specimen. We propose a two-stage methodology for causal networks, as follows. First construct a causal network from the network of metabolic pathways. The viability of this causal network depends on the validity of the causal Markov condition. If this condition fails, however, the principle of the common cause motivates the addition of a new causal arrow or a new &#096;hidden' common cause to the network (stage 2 of the model formation process). Algorithms for adding arrows or hidden nodes have been developed separately in a number of papers, and in this paper we combine them, showing how the resulting procedure can be applied to the metabolic pathway problem. Our general approach was tested on neural cell morphology data and demonstrated noticeable improvements in both prediction and network accuracy.">Two-stage Bayesian networks for metabolic network prediction</a></strong>, in Peter Lucas (ed), Proceedings of the Workshop on Qualitative and Model-Based Reasoning in Biomedicine, 9th Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Medicine Europe, 18-22 October 2003, Cyprus, pp. 19-23; <a href="https://www.cs.ru.nl/%7Epeterl/mbqr-aime03.pdf"><img src="../images/acrobat.gif" alt="" border="0" /></a> <a href="https://blogs.kent.ac.uk/jonw/files/2015/04/2stage_AIME2003.pdf"><img src="../images/acrobat.gif" alt="" border="0" /></a></p>

<p>Jon Williamson: <strong><a title="Determining a prior probability function via the maximum entropy principle can be a computationally intractable task. However one can easily determine - in advance of entropy maximisation - a list of conditional independencies that the maximum entropy function will satisfy. These independencies can be used to reduce the complexity of the entropy maximisation task. In particular, one can use these independencies to construct a direct acyclic graph in a Bayesian network, and then maximise entropy with respect to the numerical parameters of this network. This can result in an efficient representation of a prior probability function, and one that may allow efficient updating and marginalisation. The computational complexity of maximising entropy can be further reduced when knowledge of causal relationships is available. Moreover, the proposed simplification of the entropy maximisation task may be exploited to construct a proof theory for probabilistic logic.">Maximising entropy efficiently</a></strong>, <em><a href="https://www.ida.liu.se/ext/etai/received/machi/mi19.html">Electronic Transactions in Artificial Intelligence</a></em> 6, 2002; <a href="https://blogs.kent.ac.uk/jonw/files/2015/04/maxenteffic2002.pdf"><img src="../images/acrobat.gif" alt="" border="0" /></a></p>
